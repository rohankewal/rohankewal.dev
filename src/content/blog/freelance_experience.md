# My Journey into Freelance WordPress Development: A First-Time Experience

## Stepping into the World of Freelance

After having worked for a number of years as a WordPress developer, I decided to try my hand at freelancing and managing a project on my own to see how it would go.

Embarking on a freelance journey often feels like a leap into the unknown, especially for those of us transitioning from a structured 9-5 job. My first foray into freelance WordPress development was exactly that - a blend of excitement, challenge, and learning.

One of the main things I realized right away when starting this job was how much I learnt from my 9-5 job and how much value I was able to bring to this freelance job as a result of that.  The main take away from that is always keep learning and asking to do different things at work because that is what build supreme confidence and bring these skills to other jobs and help you grow as a developer and in a business sense as well.

## The Project Begins

Based in the vibrant city of London, my first client presented me with a list of changes for their website. Being new to freelancing, I meticulously evaluated the tasks and confidently set a timeline of one week, aligning it with my hourly rate. This step was crucial, as it set clear expectations for both parties and established a professional tone for our relationship.

## Balancing Act: 9-5 and Freelance

One of the most challenging aspects of this journey was the balance between my full-time job and my freelance commitments. Each day, after the duties of my 9-5 were fulfilled, I dedicated a couple of hours to the freelance project. This not only required disciplined time management but also a deep passion for web development, which kept me motivated even after long days.

## Communication: The Key to Success

Effective communication was the backbone of this project's success. Utilizing Slack, I maintained a consistent line of dialogue with my client. As each task was completed, I diligently updated them, ensuring transparency and building trust. This approach not only kept the project on track but also fostered a positive working relationship.

## Adapting to Changes

In the dynamic world of freelance, adaptability is key. Once I finished all the changes for the project, my client requested additional work. Embracing this change, I re-assessed the project scope and timelines. This was a valuable lesson in flexibility and client service, teaching me the importance of being versatile and responsive to client needs.

## Reflections and Lessons Learned

This experience was more than just a project; it was a significant growth opportunity. It taught me the importance of clear communication, time management, and adaptability. Balancing my full-time job with freelance work was challenging but incredibly rewarding, offering a taste of what it's like to manage my own business.

## Looking Ahead

As I continue on this freelance journey, I am excited to apply the lessons learned from this first project. My experience has strengthened my skills, boosted my confidence, and ignited a deeper passion for WordPress development.

In conclusion, this initial freelance project was not just about completing a task list; it was a journey of professional development and personal growth. For anyone considering a leap into freelancing, my experience stands as a testament to the challenges and rewards that await.
