Hey everyone! Today I though I would take you guys through
what a day in my life at work/work from home looks like. I
have been working from home since I started working after
college in 2021 since that was right when the COVID pandemic
had hit.

I have worked from home as a junior back-end web developer and
now as a Digital Operations Specialist working primarily with
Shopify and WordPress development.

## My Morning

I typically start my day by waking up around 7am each morning and
then geting right into the bathroom and getting ready for the work
day. I find waking up early enought to still get "ready" for work
and have a routine works much better for me to get into the mindset
to start working compared to some people who can jump out of bed right
before work starts and working in their pajamas.

I then take about 30 minutes to have some breakfast which is most of the
time some kind of cereal and I try to watch some type of news to keep up
with what is going on around the world but also local news to know what is
happening in the NJ/NYC area as well.

After breakfast, I usually start working between 8:20am and 8:30am. Right
when I start working the first thing I like to do is check my email for
any issues or requests that may have come up the night before and I also
like to check Slack for any updates from my other team members as well.

## The Afternoon

During the afternoon I will work on tasks I have been asigned either for
that day or week and other smaller tasks or issues do occasionally pop
up that I sometimes have to jump on so I would work on those as well as
they come up and then I keep pushing tasks ahead until really the end of
the day which is typically between 5pm and 5:30pm.

## Ending The Day At Night

My after-work routine and night time/sleep routine is also the same really
every single day and weekend as well. After work I usually have a cup of
coffee and maybe a small snack of chips or a cookie and I unwind from the
work day by either playing through some video game missions or watching a
show on either Netflix or Hulu.
