# What's On My Mac

Hey eveyone! Today I would like to take you guys through the age old
question: **What's On Your Computer?** I am going to go through all the
tools and software I use breifly here and then go into more detail in other
future posts.

## Terminal

The first thing on the list for any developer is the terminal they use. My
terminal of choice is iTerm 2. I use this in conjunction with Neovim and TMUX
which are other tools I use as a devleoper which I will talk more about later
in this post and in future posts. I also use Powerlevel10k as the theme along
with Oh My ZSH as the shell to make the terminal look prettier and more functional
with the information that is displays ( git, time, virtual environments).

## Code/Text Editor

My code editor of choice for a while from the time I was in college to when I first
started working was Visual Studio Code and it was a great editor for the time that I
used it. Now for the past year and a half or so I have been using the terminal code
editor, Neovim. I prefer neovim for a few reasons: one of them being the ability to
use only the keyboard to navigate between tabs and other functions to help with work
flow effeciency. One other advantage is the small amount of RAM Neovim takes up
compared to Visual Studio Code or WebStorm. I also like the idea of building the editor
from the ground up with plugins and setting up auto complete and LSPs.

## Window Manager

For my window/terminal manager I use the ever populat TMUX along with TPM to manage
plugins. Without making this too long again there will be another more detailed post
about this in the future, I always have it configured to have a main tab, a work tab
for my day job and another 3rd tab for my personal projects like this blog or other
coding projects. I also like using this to split the window into multiple panes to
keep one for Neovim and one for running the code with npm or yarn and then a third one
to use for git and file management to make my workflow and coding even more effecient.

## Other Basics For Work

Some other basic tools I use for wok and for personal projects are Slack for messaging
with my team members from my day job, Notion for both logging tasks for the team I work
with at my job and as well as a place to log my progress for any personal projects I am
working on at the time. My browser of choice for a while has been Arc by The Browser
Company. At the moment is an invite only app and I have been using it for about 6 months
now and I am really in love with it. It comes with ad blocking enabled out of the box and
it allows for different workspaces to seperate work from personal projects and allows for
split screen within the browser so you can have pages open side by side along with many
other features as well.

## Conclusion

There you have it guys, that is all the tools and software I use as a full stack web developer
who works remotly. Make sure to follow me on IG [here]("https://www.instagram.com/rohankewal")
