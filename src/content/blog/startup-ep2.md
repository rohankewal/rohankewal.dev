Hey, ShipTrack followers! üåç

Welcome back to the ShipTrack chronicles! If last week‚Äôs post showcased the fiery enthusiasm of a startup's inception, this week's episode is all about the inevitable hurdles and how we, as solo founders, can navigate them. Let's dive right in.

## The Challenge: Mapping the Trouble

Our vision for ShipTrack always included a dynamic map where users could visually track their shipments. It's an ambitious feature, one that‚Äôs been giving me quite the challenge lately.

Upon adding a new shipment, the expectation was for a marker to appear on the map, highlighting the shipment‚Äôs current location. However, as with many things in the tech world, what should have been a straightforward process took a left turn. Whenever a new shipment was added, instead of seeing a new marker, the screen went blank. No error messages, no map, just... nothing.

After a few days of debugging and using some new tools like GitHub Copilot and tabnine, I was able to fix one of the bugs, where when a new shipment is added the screen goes blank, now the shipment gets successfully added to the watchlist tabel. Now, I am still working on adding a maker to the map when a new shipment is added.

## The Pursuit of a Solution

Determined to fix this, I embarked on a coding marathon. The outcome? A decision to set up an Express server and use node-geocoder. This package would allow me to convert shipment addresses into geographical coordinates, which could then be used to place markers on the map.

But the world of startups is unpredictable. The integration of node-geocoder threw a fresh set of challenges. Configuring it correctly and ensuring seamless communication with the Express server took much longer than anticipated.

## The Solo Founder‚Äôs Dilemma: Handling Hardships

Handling such hiccups as a solo startup founder/developer is tough. You're the captain, sailor, and navigator all at once. Here's how I'm managing, and some tips for other solo founders out there:

**1. Stay Curious**: Every problem is an opportunity to learn. Dive deep into documentation, forums, and online communities. Someone, somewhere, has likely faced a similar issue.

**2. Take Breaks**: It's tempting to keep hammering away at a problem until it's fixed. But sometimes, stepping away and returning with fresh eyes can lead to an 'aha' moment.

**3. Seek Feedback**: Share your challenge with others. They might offer a perspective or solution you haven‚Äôt considered.

**4. Celebrate Small Wins**: Every hurdle you overcome is progress. Celebrate it! These small victories fuel the journey.

**5. Stay Resilient**: Challenges are an intrinsic part of the startup world. They're not a reflection of your capability but rather an invitation to grow and innovate.

## Wrapping Up

Every startup journey is punctuated with moments of doubt and hurdles. But remember, it's these very challenges that shape us, teaching resilience, innovation, and persistence.

So, if you're on your startup journey, or contemplating one, know this: The path will never be straightforward. But with determination and the right mindset, you can conquer any challenge thrown your way.

Stay tuned for next week's update where I‚Äôll share more progress and lessons from the ShipTrack voyage. And always remember, in the world of startups, it's not about the destination; it's about the journey.

Keep shipping, keep tracking and keep believing!
