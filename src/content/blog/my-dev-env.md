Hello fellow developers, start-uper's and tech enthusiasts!

Now that 2023 is over and we are in 2024 offically, I'm excited to share with you my development environment for 2024. As someone who's always on the lookout for tools that enhance productivity and streamline my coding workflow, I've settled into a powerful combo: WezTerm on Mac for my terminal needs and Neovim as my code editor. Let’s dive into why this setup works wonders for me and how it could potentially revolutionize your coding experience too!

Before we start, you can checkout any of my configs/dotfiles in my GitHub [dotfiles repo](https://www.github.com/rohankewal/dotfiles)

## Why WezTerm on Mac?
**1. Customizability:** WezTerm stands out with its incredible level of customizability. Every aspect of the terminal, from the color scheme to keyboard shortcuts, can be tailored to my preference, which makes for a comfortable and efficient coding environment.

**2. GPU Acceleration:** The smoothness in scrolling and rendering, thanks to GPU acceleration, is a game-changer. It ensures that even when dealing with large files or extensive output, my workflow remains lag-free.

**3. Tabs and Panes:** Efficient multitasking is key in development. WezTerm’s support for multiple tabs and split panes allows me to have my editor, servers, and logs open simultaneously without any hassle.

## Neovim: A Developer’s Delight
Switching to Neovim was a decision driven by the need for a fast, efficient, and highly customizable editor. But what truly sets my Neovim setup apart is the list of plugins I use:

**buffline.lua & cmp.lua:** These enhance my buffer management and autocompletion, significantly speeding up my coding process.

**copilot.lua & example.lua:** For those moments when I need a bit of coding assistance or inspiration, these plugins are lifesavers.

**harpoon.lua & lf.lua:** Navigating through files and marking important files for quick access is a breeze with these.

**lualine.lua & none-ls.lua:** Keeping an eye on important status while coding without cluttering my workspace is crucial, and these plugins help exactly with that.

**obsidian.lua & telescope.lua:** For managing my knowledge base and quickly searching through my files and code, these plugins are essential.

**treesitter.lua & catppuccin.lua:** For syntax highlighting and a soothing color scheme that makes coding sessions easier on the eyes.

**coding-action-menu.lua & dark-notify.lua:** These enhance my coding experience with handy shortcuts and notifications.

**gitsigns.lua & lazyvim.lua:** Managing Git operations within Neovim is seamless thanks to these.

**lspconfig.lua & mason.lua:** For powerful language server protocol support and managing my Neovim language servers and linters/formatters.

**notify.lua & package-info.lua:** These keep me informed about my coding environment and package updates.

**toggleterm.lua:** Integrating the terminal within Neovim makes for an incredibly streamlined workflow.

## Benefits of This Setup
**1. Efficiency:** My coding speed and efficiency have skyrocketed, thanks to the powerful combination of WezTerm and Neovim with these specific plugins.

**2. Customization:** I’ve tailored my environment precisely to my needs, which not only makes coding enjoyable but also highly productive.

**3. Learning Curve and Community:** While the learning curve for Neovim and WezTerm can be steep, the payoff is immense. Plus, the community support is fantastic.

## Tmux: Mastering Terminal Sessions
Tmux has been a cornerstone in managing my terminal sessions, allowing me to work with multiple windows within a single terminal session. This year, I’ve integrated some powerful plugins to enhance its functionality:

**t-smart-tmux-session-manager:** This plugin has been a lifesaver. It simplifies session management, allowing me to easily switch between projects and maintain session states, which is crucial for a multitasking environment.

**tmux-nerd-font-window-name:** A neat addition that allows custom window names using Nerd Fonts. It's small details like these that make the development environment not just functional but also a joy to use.

I also would like to give a major major shoutout to [Josh Medeski](https://www.joshmedeski.com) for developing these 2 amazing Tmux plugins and they are such a major part of my workflow on a daily basis.

## Arc Browser: A New Age Web Experience
The Arc browser from the Browser Company has been a recent addition to my setup. Here’s why it stands out:

**Organized Browsing:** Arc's unique approach to managing tabs and windows helps keep my online research and web applications neatly organized, which is a big plus for any developer drowned in tabs.

**Integrated Tools:** The built-in tools for note-taking, to-do lists, and more, directly in the browser, streamline my workflow. It's like having a mini productivity suite at my fingertips.

**Design and User Experience:** Arc's user interface is sleek and modern. It makes browsing a pleasant experience, enhancing my overall productivity.

If you would like to download the Arc browser(it is Mac ONLY for now) you can download it [here](https://arc.net/)

## Benefits of This Integrated Setup
**Efficiency and Productivity:** The combination of WezTerm, Neovim, Tmux, and Arc browser has significantly improved my coding speed and efficiency.

**Seamless Workflow:** With Tmux integrated into WezTerm, I can manage multiple terminal sessions effortlessly, while Neovim's powerful plugins enhance my coding capabilities.

**Enhanced Browsing:** Arc browser’s innovative approach to web browsing has helped me manage online resources better, directly impacting my development workflow.

**Customization and Learning:** Each of these tools offers deep customization, which means I can tailor my environment to exactly fit my needs. The learning curve, though steep, is incredibly rewarding.

## Wrapping Up
This setup, with its focus on efficiency, customization, and performance, is a testament to how the right tools can completely transform your development experience. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or just starting, exploring tools like WezTerm and Neovim can open up new possibilities in your coding journey.

As I continue to explore and refine my development environment, I’m excited to share more insights and learnings. Stay tuned, and happy coding!

Happy New Year everyone! Heres to a amazing and code filled 2024!
